# Migrate version 0.3.x to 0.4.x

All changes are documented in our [Changelog](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/shopware-pwa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

**BREAKING CHANGE**: moved nuxt folders inside `src` directory. `npx @shopware-pwa/cli@canary init` should do this automatically or will notify you that it can't be done by it and you should do this manually. Folders to move: `"assets", "components", "layouts", "middleware", "pages", "plugins", "static", "store"`

**BREAKING CHANGE**: we've made overriding store more simple. If you don't need a store just leave `store` directory empty or remove it. If you need to use it though, then create `src/store/indexjs` file and attach theme store.

**FEATURE**: you can now safely use `@/components/COMPONENT_NAME.vue`instead of `@shopware-pwa/default-theme/components/COMPONENT_NAME.vue` inside your project. It's not a break - old aliases will stay the same.
So for example instead of:
`import SwButton from "@shopware-pwa/default-theme/components/atoms/SwButton"`
you can type
`import SwButton from "@/components/atoms/SwButton"`
and it will import SwButton from theme or overwritten by you (created in `src/components/atoms/SwButton.vue`)

**FEATURE**: you can explicitly call theme by using `@theme` alias.
So for example even if you overwritten SwButton as above you can still call theme SwButton like this:
`import SwButton from "@theme/components/atoms/SwButton"`

**MIGRATION STEP**: change import in `src/assets/main.scss` from `@import '~@shopware-pwa/default-theme/assets/scss/main';` to `@import '@theme/assets/scss/main';`

**MIGRATION STEP**: change import in `src/assets/variables.scss` from `@import '~@shopware-pwa/default-theme/assets/scss/variables';` to `@import '@theme/assets/scss/variables';`

**REFACTOR(default-theme)**: `SwAddress` in `components/forms/SwAddress` has been renamed to `SwAddressForm` to avoid duplications with `SwAddress` in `components/SwAddress.vue`

**FEATURE**: introduced `useDefaults` composable, which is used inside other composables to provide specific fields from API. You can extend it in `shopware-pwa.config.js` file. Read how in [useDefaults docs](/landing/resources/api/composables.usedefaults.html)

**FEATURE**: we introduced Interceptors functionality to listen on events across application. More [here](/landing/concepts/interceptor.html)

**FEATURE**: you can use new `useNotifications` composable to manage notifications in your app; best combination is to use it with Interceptors functionality.
