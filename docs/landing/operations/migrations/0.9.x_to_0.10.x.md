# Changes description and Migrate version 0.9.x to 0.10.x

::: warning POTENTIAL DEPENDENCY PROBLEMS
In case of **problems with dependencies** (mismatch, not installed, etc...) that may appear, we encourage you to follow those steps:

1. update the version in package.json (`@shopware-pwa/nuxt-module`)
2. `yarn upgrade`
3. `yarn shopware-pwa init` (or `npx @shopware-pwa/cli@canary init`)
4. `yarn dev` (do not use npx for anything else than init)

what else could help if not this:

- remove `node_modules` directory and `yarn.lock` file
- (**DO BACKUP BEFORE**) remove `nuxt.config.js` and invoke `npx @shopware-pwa/cli init`
