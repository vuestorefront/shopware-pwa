### API Versioning

Shopware adheres to a versioning principle where a new API version is released with every new major version. The current Major Version of Shopware 6 is 3.

:::tip Shopware Version
The full version name of Shopware (e.g. as of release shopware-pwa 0.3.0) is 6.3.0.1, where 6 is just the "product family, but not relevant for versioning
:::

The supported API versions of Shopware 6 are v3 and v2. Generally speaking, each major version x supports API versions x and x-1. So we have to accomodate for that mechanism.

We want Shopware PWA to be in sync with the latest endpoints of Shopware, to be able to ship new features to you as soon as they are released within Shopware.
