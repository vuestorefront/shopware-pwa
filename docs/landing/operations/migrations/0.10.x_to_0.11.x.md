## Different domains allowed <Badge text="BREAKING CHANGE" type="error"/>

The routing mechanism [has been extended](https://github.com/vuestorefront/shopware-pwa/pull/1577) and provides handling the different domains working on the same Shopware PWA instance. 

::: warning
`pwaHost` entry in `shopware-pwa.config.js` is becoming deprecated. Start using `shopwareDomainsAllowList` (an array) setting.
:::

In order to synchronise the different domains configured in the backend settings (Setting > Sales Channel > Domains) there are additional steps:

- open `shopware-pwa.config.js` file
- add `shopwareDomainsAllowList` entry with a list of domains that must be handled by Shopware PWA


```js {
// part of `shopware-pwa.config.js`:
    ...
    shopwareDomainsAllowList: ['http://shopware-pwa.test', 'http://en.shopware-pwa.test', 'http://shopware-pwa.test/en']
}
```

then run `shopware-pwa domains` command again. The new routing configuration will be built in the next Nuxt build process (explained [here](../../concepts/routing.md)).
