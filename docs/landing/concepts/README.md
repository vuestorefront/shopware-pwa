# Concepts

No matter whether you're familiar with Shopware or not - you might have come across some concepts that are built into the PWA. We put a lot of effort into reflecting core concepts from Shopware into the PWA to give it a more native feeling if you already know Shopware 6.

## Shopping Experiences

The content management system is certainly one of the most prominent features built into Shopware. We have prepared a guide to dig into the structure of our CMS and how to use and extend it within the PWA.

## Plugins

Plugins are a common concept in Shopware applications. Learn how they translate to the PWA world and how to use them to inject custom components into your layout.

## Payment and Checkout

Checkout and payment are critical parts within every eCommerce application. Learn how payments are adopted and captured using the Shopware API and how they translate into a programmatic API that you can use in the PWA.

## Events Interceptor

Broadcast or/and intercept events across the application between the layers. With interceptors you can react on some system events broadcasted from other parts of the application.

Shopware-pwa provides an unified error's structure for all errors that may appear during working with Shopware 6 API.
