Simple state management for UI purposes. If you pase `stateName` on composable invocation (ex. `useUIState('sidebarCart')`<!-- -->), then state is shared between all instances with this key. Otherwise state is local, so multiple `useUIState()` will not share state

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
useUIState: (stateName?: string | undefined) => {
    isOpen: Readonly<Ref<boolean>>;
    switchState: (to?: boolean | undefined) => void;
}
```
