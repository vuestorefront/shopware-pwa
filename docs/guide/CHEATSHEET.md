# Setup Cheatsheet

This cheatsheet will give you an overview of the Shopware PWA project and how to set it up for development.

## General

`Shopware PWA` is a collaborative project between Vue Storefront and Shopware with the goal of providing an alternative Storefront based on the Vue Storefront Next architecture. It uses the Shopware Sales-Channel API for communication to the Shopware backend.

As both projects are still undergoing development, we decided to mitigate potential delays through an additional Shopware plugin `SwagShopwarePwa` which extends the Sales-Channel API. Eventually, once the core will provide those functionalities, the plugin will be dumped and not required anymore.

There will be a more streamlined, interactive development setup, but for now we're focussing on progress and stability of the platform.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- `shopware/platform` running within either `shopware/development` or `shopware/production`
- `node@^10` installed
- `yarn` package manager installed

### Installation steps

#### Shopware setup

Note: You can skip this section if you just want to try the PWA. It will be preconfigured to use a public instance.

1.  Make sure you have a running Shopware 6 instance (preferably stable 6.2 once available)
2.  Clone [SwagShopwarePwa](https://github.com/elkmod/SwagShopwarePwa) into your `custom/plugins` directory.
3.  Install the plugin by running `bin/console plugin:install --activate SwagShopwarePwa`
4.  Refresh the indices using `bin/console dal:refresh:index`
5.  Go to the admin panel and copy the API access key from your sales channel settings
6.  Make sure that you have proper domain configured in your sales channel settings - should contain your PWA instance URL (otherwise, the customer registration won't be possible - since v6.2)

#### PWA setup

1.  Clone the [shopware-pwa](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/shopware-pwa) project into a directory of your choice.
2.  Run `yarn` in the root and then `yarn build --types`.
3.  Go anywhere outside the project
4.  Create your own project directory `mkdir my-project` and go inside `cd my-project`
5.  run `npx @shopware-pwa/cli init` or `shopware-pwa init` for the globally installed package
6.  run `yarn dev`
7.  Your application will be available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Now you have complete ShopwarePWA project running locally

##### Running Shopware PWA on custom Shopware instance

1. add new file `shopware-pwa.config.js` inside root of newly created project
2. fill it with your needs

```
module.exports = {
  shopwareEndpoint: "https://shopware6-demo.vuestorefront.io/",
  shopwareAccessToken: "SWSCVJJET0RQAXFNBMTDZTV1OQ"
};
```

3. run again `npx @shopware-pwa/cli init` (or `shopware-pwa init`) and then `yarn dev`

##### Developing Shopware PWA

If you'd like to develop Shopware PWA, then run inside your created project `shopware-pwa dev` instead of `yarn dev`. It will watch files and components in `shopware-pwa/packages/default-theme` and instantly copy changes to your project.
